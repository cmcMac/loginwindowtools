This repository is intended to host small projects that deal with the !MacOS X loginwindow. The main aim is to provide a code library for starting points for developers to create their own versions of software that runs at the loginwindow, either beside the loginwindow/securityagent or as plugins to it.

All items in this project should fall under the Apache 2 license.

The first two additions to the project are in:

  * AuthorizationPluginTemplate - a simple plugin to provide a skeleton to write AuthorizationPlugins around

  * AklogAuthPlugin - a plugin to run 'aklog' as part of the loginwindow process to help with AFS home directories
